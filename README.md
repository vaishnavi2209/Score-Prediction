# Score-Prediction
THE PROJECT WAS UNDER INTERNSHIP
Task-1 as Data science and business analytics intern at The Sparks Foundation. This project uses a supervised machine learning method i.e. linear regression to predict the percentage of a student based on the no. of study hours.

# Project Introduction
To predict the percentage of a student based on the no. of study hours using the supervised machine learning method i.e. linear regression.

# Description 
The objective of this was a prediction of the percentage of a student based on the no. of study hours by using supervised machine learning through linear regression. 
The dataset was being provided by the company for this project. This is a simple linear regression model that involves two variable. The language prefered for this task for python & the libraries used are numpy, pandas, seaborn,matplotlib & Sk-Learn.
The project had the following parts - 

* Data Visualisation - This involved plotting the corresponding graphs between hours of study & percentage scored for which matplotlib was used. The correlation between hours and score is also found.

* Preparing the Data - In this, the data is divided into attributes and labels. Furthermore, the training and testing sets are made using Scikit-Learn 

* Traning Algorithm - This is the most vital part of any model. In this, the model is trained that how it has to work. After successfully training the algorithm the regression line is plotted.

* Predictions - In this stage, there is a comparison between the actual values and predicted values & the graph is plotted accordingly.

* Evaluating the model - This step is particularly important to compare how well different algorithms perform on a particular dataset. For simplicity, I have chosen the mean square error. There are many such metrics. Further, the classification report is generated.
